A collection of line-drawing algorithms for use in graphics and video games.

Currently implemented:

* `Bresenham` - An implementation of [Bresenham's line algorithm].
* `Bresenham3d` - A 3-Dimensional implementation of bresenham.
* `BresenhamCircle` - Bresenham's circle algorithm.
* `BresenhamEllipse` - Bresenham's ellipse algorithm.
* `Midpoint` - The [mid-point line algorithm].
* `WalkGrid` and `Supercover` - implemented from [this article by Red Blob Games][article].
* `WalkVoxels` - A similar 3-Dimensional algorithm that only takes orthogonal steps.
* `XiaolinWu` - [Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm].
